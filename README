AnCal Extended - a fork of AnCal, the personal-information-manager for Android.
AnCal was originally written by Piotr Zagawa (http://vetch.magot.pl/pages/ancal.html),
its project-page can be found at http://code.google.com/p/ancal/.

This is my private fork of AnCal, planned extensions are:
 
 - enhanced localisation
 - import of birthdays from contacts
 - minor UI-enhancments like context menus for quicker navigation
 
 This repository is NOT related to the original AnCal project or its author!
